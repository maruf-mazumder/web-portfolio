            <h3>A disproportionate number of bright students listen to metal. No wonder - it's difficult, erudite and still the voice of the outsider</h3>
    
            <p>As Metallica once said, let it be written. It's not the students who love Radiohead that are likely to be the brainiest in their University but the kid down the hall with the Tool t-shirt and a fixation with the floor. A study published today reveals that a disproportionate number of members in the National Academy for Gifted and Talented Youth (a body of 120,000 students which represents the top 5% of academic achievement) list heavy metal - or "metal", as its devotees these days know it - as their favourite kind of music.</p>

                Listening to 'extreme' music makes you calmer, not angrier, according to study</h1>
             <h4>Rather than inciting people to anger or violence, research has found that loud and chaotic music such as metal and punk is ‘a healthy way of processing anger’</h3>   
            <p>
                Heavy metal is more commonly associated with headbanging, satanism, moshpits and the decapitation of small mammals. According to a new study, however, metal, and all forms of “extreme” music, can positively influence the listener, inspiring calmness rather than anger.

                A study by the University of Queensland, the Australian public research institution in Brisbane, revealed that rather than proving the hypothesis that “extreme music causes anger”, the theory that “extreme music matches and helps to process anger” was supported instead.

            <p>The corporate world can be very daunting or very demanding, especially when you are a fresher. From a comparatively plain sailing journey of a college/university life to a highly competitive working environment, the transition is never easy. Yet I can tell you that getting into the battleground is damn exciting.You get to learn technologies that you might have never heard of, learn stuff from the elites out there and the best of all; you feel important because your code and your effort matters to the company.The only problem is that you just don’t become an integral part of a team overnight as you need to prove yourself. The only way to prove yourself is by your work, and the only way to get the work done is to learn all that you can. You will gradually realize that it is a process and being surrounded by people sharing common interests, you are most likely to find this transition easier than it initially seemed to be. </p>
